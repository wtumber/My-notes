* create H0 (null) and H1 (alternate).
* Define significance level (eg. 0.05). If two-tailed then 0.05 is 0.025 each side
* Find z-score
* Find test statistic
* sufficient evidence to reject the null or not?

## stats to consider
Methods:
* measures of central tendency
	* Mean, Mode, median.
* Skewness
* Variance & covariance
* Correlations
* Discrete distributions
	* Poisson,equiprobable, Binomial ( X ~ B(10,0.6) ) 
* Continuous distributions
	* Gaussian, uniform, chi-squared, exponential, students t, logistic.
* CLT - use sampling distribution of the means to approximate normal dist where mean is the same as the population mean, usually sample size n>30
