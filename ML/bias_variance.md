# Bias and Variance
> [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuBBz3bI-aA) 

The inability for an ML method to capture a true relationship is called **Bias**. We can compare the model bias by calculating sum of squares. The difference in fits of an ML model between datasets is called **Variance**. A model with very low bias with the training set but high variance indicates overfitting.

Commonly used methods to find the sweet spot between variance and bias are: **regularization, boosting, and bagging**.
