## My notes


This repo contains some notes I make from online content and any links to materials I plan to use in the future.

This is a work in progress. I aim to transfer all links to resources into this central location.

some courses are still contained on [this page](https://github.com/wtumber/com519_project/blob/main/project_code/create_initial_data/start_lists.py) of University Project COM519.
