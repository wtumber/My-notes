## My notes from online content

This is a repo containing any notes I make from online content and any links to materials I plan to use in the future.

The README will act as a master page, with further markdown pages denoting specific sections or content, such as the [Courses](/Courses.md) document.

Currently working through [StatQuest Machine learning content](/statquest/README.md).
