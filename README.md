## My notes


This repo contains some notes I make from online content and any links to materials I plan to use in the future.

This is a work in progress. I aim to transfer all links to resources into this central location.

some courses are still contained on [this page](https://shielded-fortress-22361.herokuapp.com/guides) of University Project COM519.

### Navigating this repo

The README will act as a master page, with further markdown pages denoting specific sections or content, such as the [Courses](/Courses.md) document.

Currently working through [StatQuest Machine learning content](/statquest/README.md).
